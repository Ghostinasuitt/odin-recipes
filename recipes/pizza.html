<h1>Barbeque Chicken Grilled Pizza</h1>
<img src="../images/pizza.jpeg">

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. 
    I often make as an appetizer while the ribs are cooking. 
    Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, 
    but the barbeque chicken is always a crowd pleaser!
     The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, 
     but we have fun guessing what it looks like ('That looks like America!'). 
     For the chicken, I use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>
<ul>

    <li>1 cup chopped cooked chicken</li>
    <li>a half cup barbeque sauce, divided</li>
    <li>1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup diced tomatoes, or to taste</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ul>

    <li>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 2 rectangles. 
            Brush the top of each rectangle with olive oil.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; 
            cook until bottom of dough is browned and top is bubbling up,
             about 5 minutes. Brush the tops of each dough with oil and flip.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Spread the remaining barbeque sauce over each crust;
             top with chicken, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese,
              and tomatoes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese is melted,
             2 to 3 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and cool before slicing,
              2 to 3 minutes.</p>
    </li>
