    <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
        This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book.
         Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card,
          this was a family favorite.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and a half cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 and a half teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>a quarter teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 and a quarter cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, 
                            baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk,
                             egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
                             Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
                              Brown on both sides and serve hot.</p>
                    </li>
